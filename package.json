  "description": "This example demonstrates how to build a Node.js API that leverages an AI service for generating illustrations from text input. The API is created using the Express.js framework and allows users to send requests with text descriptions. It then communicates with an AI service, such as OpenAI's GPT-3 with image generation capabilities, to generate and return custom illustrations based on the provided text. The API handles error responses, security considerations, and provides a simple endpoint for generating illustrations, making it a powerful tool for integrating AI-powered illustration generation into various applications and services.",
